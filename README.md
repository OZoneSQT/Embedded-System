# Embedded-System
This is a Arduino/C/C++ repository using an arduino nano and a begalboard focusing on bare metal coding for my embedded system's class, SOEN 422, at Concordia University during Fall 2017

## System Setup
1. Visual Studio
2. Arduino IDE (with drivers)
3. Visual Micro (VS extension) - Apendix 1.0 + 1.1

### Apendix
1.0 ![Initial Setup Page for Micro Visual](https://imgur.com/a/qy4gl "Initial Setup Page for Micro Visual")
