## Theory Questions
1. Which Microcontroller does the Arduino Nano use? **ATmega328**
2. What is the default clock speed for this Microcontroller? **16MHz**
3. How can you change the clock speed? And what can you change it to? **By defining the preprocessor F_CPU; you can set this to any MHz value the chip supports**
4. Some of the libraries that weâ€™ve seen use a constant F_CPU, what does this variable do? **This is not a varaible. It is used to calculate the values needed in function like `_delay_ms()`**
5. Why does the Arduino IDE not complain when you forget to define F_CPU? **The Arduino IDE by default passes the correct command line arguement for your micro-controller**
