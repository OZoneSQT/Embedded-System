## Introduction
- Problem Statement: blahh.....
- Abbreviations and Acronyms
  - LED == Light Emiting Diode
  - DDRx, PBn, etc... Registers names
  - OCR == output compare register
  - IR == infra red
  - ADC == analog to digital conversion
  - PWM == pulse with modulation
 
## Resources 
- Hardware Resources
  - Arduino Nano
  - LEDs
  - Push Button
  - Resistors
  - Jumper Wires
  - IR Sensor
- Hardware Setup
  - Part 2...

## Software Resources
- Software setup
  - IDE is Visual Studio 2017 Enterprise
  - Compilers are the avr-gcc/avr-g++ for windows
  - Visual studio has an extension called [Visual Micro](http://www.visualmicro.com/) which handles everything from compiling to upload (it just needs to be configured similar to the Arduino IDE)
 
## Program Snipets

## Reference Code Common
- the basic Arduino bare metal IO.h for access to pins and registers and basic definitions
- HardwareSerial.h for serial communitcation
- The supplied ADC code was extremely useful, I just specialized it to my particular case.

## Discussion/Conclusion
